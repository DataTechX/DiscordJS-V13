## Introduction
## Hello there, this sentence will mark the beginning of my first ever article released to the public. In this, and the following articles I will introduce beginners to the magical world of Discord bots. I will be using the new discord.js v13 library. However, there are certain prerequisites.


## Prerequisites
At least beginner knowledge of Javascript. I've seen this all too much, eager new developers asking to be spoon-fed basic Javascript and Node.js fundamentals. There are innumerable fantastic resources out there, like freeCodeCamp. Don't be scared to use Google, DuckDuckGo, or any other search engine.
Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. As this is an article about Discord.js solely, I wont be going in to the specifics here. You can download Node.js and NPM @ https://nodejs.org/. Again, Google is your friend in case you're unsure as to how to install Node.JS properly. Discord.js requires Node.js version 14.0.0 or newer.
